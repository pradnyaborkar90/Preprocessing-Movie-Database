# Preprocessing-Movie-Database
This program uses the Large Movie Review Dataset available at http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/.
A progress bar is made using pyprind which visualizes the progress of reading dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
The progress bar has 50000 iterations which represents the number of input reviews read from the dataset.
Numpy is used for storing our outputs in the csv file.

Python Packages used are:
Pyprind - pip install pyprind 
Numpy - pip install numpy
Pandas - pip install pandas
